# Ripper - Preface

The â€˜Ripper' app is meant to enable users to create new Revit central files in a batch process. This can be usefull when:

* Any number of consultant files has been downloaded and then need to be updated in our file system on a reoccurring basis
* Any number of Revit files need to be archived
* Any number of Revit files need to be prepared for Issue which may require:
	* Certain views require deleting, 
	* NavisWorks, IFC, DWG, or DWFx files need to be created from the Revit models issued
	* Some clean up python scripts are required to be executed once the Revit models have been detached
	* Links need to be removed
* In an audit process, Revit files need to re-created in the same location  
* Revit files need upgrading to a newer version of Revit

## User Interface

Ripper is located within the BVN Tab on the Utilities Panel:

![RipperIcon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/Icon-Ripper_BVN_ToolBar.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="128px" width="619px"}

Before using Ripper, all Revit files will need to be closed on that computer only. Revit may crash if a file, which is currently open, is being detached using Ripper on the same computer. It is ok to have the same Revit file open on any other computer. 

![RipperInRevit]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/Revit_Sample_AllClosed.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="1040px" width="960px"}


The user interface comprises of multiple windows:

### Detach Tab

![RipperMainDetach]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/GUI-Ripper-Main-Detach-doc.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="800px" width="630px"}


This is the main tab controlling which files are to be detached and whether any additional conditions apply to the detach process.

| Item | Function |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Determines whether any Revit files located in subdirectories in the source folder path are to be displayed in the file list below. |
| 2 | Shows the workset [dialogue](#WorksetDialogue) where the user can choose which workset to keep closed during the detach process. |
| 3 | Source folder path containing the Revit files you want to detach. (red font indicates an invalid folder path)|
| 4 | Switches between file server (FS) or Revit server (RS) file location. Default is file server i.e. P:\ drive |
| 5 | Folder path to where the detached files will be saved to. This can be the same as the source folder path if files just need to be overwritten. (red font indicates an invalid folder path) |
| 6 | When checked, Ripper will attempt to purge out all unused loadable families. No system families are affected by this process. |
| 7 | When checked, Ripper will purge all views (that includes sheets, schedules and legends) which are not marked as excluded in the views [dialogue](#ViewsDialogue). |
| 8 | When checked, Ripper will attempt to remove any other links from a file. See [here](#LinksDialogue) for further information. |
| 9 | List of Revit files available to be detached. Multiple files can be selected at once for processing |
| 10 | Settings can be imported from a text file or exported to a text file. Since settings are stored by user this could be used to distribute them quickly amongst team members. |
| 11 | Quits the app |
| 12 | Starts the detach process |

#### <a id="WorksetDialogue"></a> Detach Tab - Worksets

![RipperMainDetach_Workset]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/GUI-Ripper-Main-Detach-Workset-doc.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="300px" width="600px"}

This dialogue can be used to define which worksets are not opened during the detach process.i.e all worksets known to contain Revit links could be closed to considerably speed up the process. 

| Item | Function |
|------|----------|
| Condition | Contains: the workset name needs to contain a given value (case sensitive), Begins with: the workset name need to begin with a given value. |
| Value | The actual value the condition needs to meet. Can be characters or numbers or both. |


#### <a id="ViewsDialogue"></a> Detach Tab - Views

![RipperMainDetach_Views]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/GUI-Ripper-Main-Detach-Views-doc.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="300px" width="600px"}


If you want to purge some but not all views from the Revit file(s) then tick 'Purge Views' and use the Purge View Settings interface to specify which views you would like to exclude from being purged (aka which views you would like to keep).
As stated above, ripper considers the following items as 'views':

* Legends
* Sheets (the filter will apply to the sheet number!)
* Schedules
* All kind of plans, sections, elevations, camera and 3D views

| Item | Function |
|------|----------|
| Condition | Contains: the view name needs to contain a given value (case sensitive), Begins with: the view name need to begin with a given value. |
| Value | The actual value the condition needs to meet. Can be characters or numbers or both. |

##### Sample View Naming

The below demonstrates how, by applying the same prefix to all view names, the entire content of a sheet can be preserved when using Ripper's 'Purge Views' functionality. 
This could be used to i.e. preserve General Arrangement drawings in a detached model only.

![RipperMainDetach_Views_Sample]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/Revit_Sample_ViewNaming.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="853px" width="468px"}


#### <a id="LinksDialogue"></a> Detach Tab - Links

![RipperMainDetach_Links]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/GUI-Ripper-Main-Detach-PurgeLinks-doc.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="195px" width="445px"}

NOTE: This is beta only and may cause the detached file to become corrupt due to 'To many elements missing' error. This error occurs when tags or other elements associated with elements in linked files loose their host i.e. the link they refer to has been removed. 

| Item | Function |
|------|----------|
| 1 | When checked Ripper will attempt to either unload or delete all Revit links. |
| 2 | Choose whether to unload or completely remove any Revit links |
| 3 | When checked Ripper will attempt to either unload or delete all CAD links. |
| 4 | Choose whether to unload or completely remove any CAD links |

### Export Tab

![RipperMainExport]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ripper/GUI-Ripper-Main-Export-doc.png){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="470px" width="630px"}

When issuing a Revit model to the consultant team, we may also have to provide the same model in a different file format i.e. NavisWorks cache (.nwc). This tab provides the option to export the model or parts there of to the following formats:

* NavisWorks Cache (.nwc)
* AutoCad (.dwg)
* Industry Foundation Class (.ifc)
* Design Web Format (.dwfx)


| Item | Function |
|------|----------|
| 1 | When checked Ripper will export the model as specified in the [settings](#ExportNavisWorks) to NavisWorks (.nwc) format |
| 2 | Folder location where .nwc exports will be saved. |
| 3 | When checked Ripper will export the model as specified in the [settings](#ExportDWG) to AutoCAD (.dwg) format |
| 4 | Folder location where .dwg exports will be saved. |
| 5 | When checked Ripper will export the model as specified in the [settings](#ExportIFC) to Industry Foundation Class (.ifc) format |
| 6 | Folder location where .ifc exports will be saved. |
| 7 | When checked Ripper will export the model as specified in the settings to Design Web Format (.dwfx) format |
| 8 | Folder location where .dwfx exports will be saved. |

| 2 | This defines which views will be exported to NavisWorks.  Note that the .nwc file name will be the derived from the view name: the first 5 characters of the view name will be removed to allow the view named 'ETN - YOUR FILE NAME'. Where ETN is used to identify views which are Exported To Navis. |
| Condition | Contains: the view name needs to contain a given value (case sensitive), Begins with: the view name need to begin with a given value. |
| Value | The actual value the condition needs to meet. Can be characters or numbers or both. |
