# Ripper - Preface

The â€˜Ripper' app is meant to enable users to create new Revit central files in a batch process. This can be usefull where:

* Any number of consultant files has been downloaded and then need to be updated in our file system on a reoccurring basis
* Any number of Revit files need to be archived
* Any nubmer of Revit files need to be prepared for Issue which may require:
	* Certain views require deleting, 
	* NavisWorks, IFC, DWG, or DWFx files need to be created from the Revit models issued
	* Some clean up python scripts are required to be executed once the Revit models have been detached
	* Links need to be removed
* In an audit process, Revit files need to re-created in the same location  
* Revit files need upgrading to a newer version of Revit

Notes:

* Do not place any superseded family files into your Revit library. The family re-loader will not be able to differentiate between your current family XYZ and your superseded family XYZ with the same name and might reload the family from the wrong file.
