# Family Reporter - Preface

The â€˜Family Reporter' app is used to gather a number of properties from families and their catalog files. Those log files can either be used to [visualize](https://annisarivera.github.io/mastercontent/) the state of your Revit content or modified in Excel and then applied to families via the [Family Updater app]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/2017-06-15-FamilyUpdater/).

Summary of log files and properties they report:

| Log File | Properties |
|---------|------------|
| [FamilyCategory Log](#FamCategoryLog) | Reports the Revit Category of a family |
| [FamilyDefault Log](#FamDefaultLog) | Reports: Revit Version number, Edited last time stamp, and whether a family uses a catalogue file |
| [FamilySubCategory Log](#FamSubCatLog) | Reports Revit subcategories present in a family. |
| [Family Types Log](#FamTypesLog) | Reports all family types defined in a family file and, if present, in its associated catalogue file. |
| [Host Families Log](#FamHostLog) | Reports all families which contain nested families |
| [Materials Log](#MaterialsLog) | Reports all materials defined in family file. |
| [Nested Families Log](#FamNestedLog) | Reports all nested families together with their host family. |
| [OmniClass Log](#FamOmniLog) | Reports the Omni class of a family. |
| [Parameters Log](#FamParaLog) | Reports all parameters present in a family and their properties but not values |
| [ParameterValuesByTypes Log](#FamParaValuebyTypeLog) | Reports parameter values by family type. Report includes family types defined in a catalogue files. |
| [Reference Planes Log](#FamRefPlanesLog) | Reports all reference planes present in a family and their properties |
| [Units Log](#FamUnitsLog) | Reports units set for area, volume, angle, number and length |

## Log File Formats

Log files are available in MS Excel and .txt format.

### MS Excel

These log files are formatted to easily identify which fields can be edited and therefore used to update family properties.

* Cells with a grey back ground are read only.
* Cells with a white bac ground can be edited. Most reports will also have a drop down enabled to allow selection of pre-defined actions.

### Text Files

Text log files are tab separated text files. No colour coding indicating editable fields or data validation is available in these files.
