# Summary

Push it is meant to streamline the process of rapid plan layout development in Revit.
Revit has issues with:

  * Moving rooms
    * Moving rooms to different levels
    * Moving rooms around on a floor plate 
  * Model performance
    * A large number of rooms within a single model 
  * Data
    * Keeping track of which rooms have been placed in a model from a given schedule
    * Enforcing consistent naming and numbering schemes for rooms
    * Enforcing a consistent data structure

## Moving rooms 

The first couple of issues stem from the way rooms are created and there extent is defined in Revit. Rooms require walls or room bounding lines to define their extent. Any change in room location will require changes to those elements which is quite time consuming. 

In order to change the level location of a room it will actually need to be cut from the old level and paste to the new level. Revit internally assigns a new element ID to the room pasted, which means any associations to the old room via its element ID are lost.

## Model performance

Revit slows down considerably when a large number of rooms are present in the model. This is due to Revit evaluating all the time if a change to one room effects other rooms or properties of other objects (like doors) placed in rooms.

## Data

Keeping track of which rooms have been placed in the Revit model is challenging for large projects. Whilst the model can be pre populated with room data via 3rd party software this has some draw backs. 

* The current Revit user interface does not allow to sort or filter the list of unplaced rooms. This leads to a lot of scrolling up and down the list to get to a specific room.
* Checking for duplicate placement will need to be done via a Revit schedule. 
* It is hard to keep track of rooms which have been completely removed from the model intentionally or un-intentionally

Naming rooms consistently eg Store Linen vs Linen Store can be particularly hard to achieve especially when multiple models and team members are involved. Revit scheduling can help finding those inconsistencies but this is more a treating the symptoms rather than the cause approach.

Last but not least consistent data structures. Revit out of the box does not provide any ways to ensure that all relevant properties of a room have their values set in a consistent manner. 

# Push It (real good)!

Push it! aims at addressing the above issues in a two pronged approach: 
* Providing custom 'room' families to facilitate 
  * Rapid and easy layout development 
  * Easy and fast changes to layouts and design options
* Additional user interface in Revit to allow:
  * Sorting and filtering of rooms to be placed
  * provide user with direct feedback as to which rooms have been placed already
  * Populating given room properties with data
  * Updating room data during the development cycle 


## Custom 'Room' families

The approach outlined below has been successfully implemented on: 
- Northern Beaches Hospital - Competition with approx 2970 rooms in single Revit model placed
- Uni of South Australia Health Innovation Building - approx 750 rooms in single Revit model placed 
- Kai Tak Hospital Hong Kong - SD stage with a total of approx 8900 rooms modelled (distributed across 3 separate building models: 1265/1255/6380 )


### Shapes

These families come in varies shapes and use cases:

* Base Shapes (Revit Category Column):
	* SP-Room-Rectangle-Double-Door_8.rfa 
	![SP-Room-Bed-Rectangle_7]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/20170516_Pushit_demo/ROOM-RECTANGLE-DOUBLE_DOOR.svg){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="400px" width="600px"}

Note: the number at the end refers to the version of the family. Ideally a project should use always families of the same version.

### Family Set-up

Initially these families started of as Generic Model families. Later on during the development of this system, they where changes to column families in order for them to be room bounding and therefore usable with proper Revit rooms if so required.
A side effect of this is that, with the exception of the families listed as multi storey families above, these families do not have a base or top level property but just a level property. Therefore when trying to schedule these families via a standard
Revit column schedule, no level data for base or top level will be shown. However if a multi-category schedule is used instead, the simple level property is available and contains data.

Proper column families where only used for lifts and risers for instance. Here the capability to define a top and bottom level is important to show a consistent core location across multiple floors.

Another initial goal was to set up the families in a way so they can display a simple line graphic with no wall thickness as well as a wall thickness. This was attempted via the Revit detail level of specific elements and nesting of multiple families within each column family set to show at certain detail levels only.
Each family contains two nested families:
	* Generic Model (visible in medium and fine detail) and modelled to inside face of walls
	* Detail Item (visible in coarse detail only) and modelled to centre line of wall

This was done to allow for colouring of rooms via filters. These filters can operate on the following properties:
	* SP_Department, 
	* SP_Subdepartment, 
	* Functional Group

When colouring rooms in views set to coarse detail level, the filter will need to be applied to columns.

However when colouring rooms in medium and fine detail level rather than colouring the column families itself, the filter should target the nested and shared Generic Model family instead. This allows to colour the background of a room and leaves items placed in a room, e.g. beds
white and not effected by the filter.

If no filter is applied, colour coding indicates how the designed area compares to briefed area:
	* red is under area
	* blue is over area
	* green is on area (within 1 % range)

![SP-Room-Bed-Rectangle_7]({{ site.baseurl }}/_docs/20170516_Pushit_demo/ColourByArea.svg){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="600px" width="900px"}

The family instance property SP_Area_Designed shows the area of the 'room' to centre line of wall. Its value is calculated on the fly.

In general, shared parameters are used to drive size and SOA properties. This is to allow for swapping out of family shapes but maintaining, at the same time, size and other properties, e.g. room name for instance.

The build in label is meant to be used for modelling support only. On plot views, a separate tag should be used and the build in label be switched off via a filter.

### Family manipulation

The size of a room can be manipulated by either:
	* entering values into Sp_Width or SP_Depth parameters
	* aligning the centre line of wall to stretch a room ( Revit glitch: sometimes these rooms start to stretch AND move at the same time. This behaviour starts and stops without any apparent reason )
	* aligning the outer or inner face of wall to change room location ( exception of risers where the aligning to inner face of wall will stretch the family)
	* selecting the level property to move rooms up and down the building (note: if host is not a Revit Level then host need to be changed to a Revit level via 'pick new host' command)
	* Ceiling height property drives the height of all the SP_Room families but the multi storey ones listed above

Most room families have doors included. Doors location along wall can be changed as well as the swing direction, which can be flipped to go in or out of room. If an additional door is required you can use of the SP-Door families

With the exception of the Rectangle based families, all shapes can switch off their walls if required, to function as a bay only.

### Irregular Shapes

Irregular shapes are supported through the BVN 'Get A Room' Revit plugin. This requires the user to draw the outline of the required room or rooms, including its (their) wall thickness, as filled regions first. Once those regions have been converted into rooms, Push It can be used to populate them with SOA data.

The rooms created this way are static in size and can not be amended via Width or Depth properties. Any change to the shape of the room will require a redraw which makes this a fairly slow process. 

### Drawing Set up

On previous projects, BVN was required to show some massing and stacking diagrams as well as 1 to 200 floor plans. Since we used Revit mass objects to do the stacking diagrams, it was decided to use associated mass floors to colour the overall department boundaries on the 1 to 200 floor plans. This worked fine in Revit 2014 but the latest project under taken in Revit 2017 showed major glitches in Revit, when trying to print to PDF. On a regular basis mass floors used to colour areas would not print when using vector printing but printed just fine when switching to raster printing.

After some testing the solution adopted was to use a stacked views on sheet approach: The bottom (first placed view) would contain mass floors and standard floors only. The top view would contain the room elements and everything else making up the plot sheet.

This is certainly not an ideal scenario from an end user perspective. Trials with area plans where successfully undertaken at the Hong Kong Kai Tak project but due to the time frame not implemented across the entire project.

### Area Calculation

On a regular basis projects are required to provide area schedules as a measure how efficient a proposed layout is. These area schedules are usually broken down in net and gross area. In this scenario net area is identical to the area of the briefed rooms. Gross area is the briefed area plus any circulation and plant space. Often this is expressed as a percentage figure of the net area.

When using custom rooms families only briefed rooms will be placed. There are (at least) two options to model the gross area:

* mass floors by department
* area plans by department

Each option requires an element to be modelled, and updated with any layout changes, which covers the extent of an entire department or sub department. The circulation area of a specific department is than the gross area minus the net area retrieved from the room families of this department. 

Area calculations themselves can done in Excel in form of data links to schedules exported from Revit.
