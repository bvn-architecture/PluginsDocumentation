# Doors

## Non – fire rated doors

Assume

*	40 thick min. 45 thick if flush bolts and Pivots including WC pivots are used. NB WC pivots have been installed in 40 thick but 45 thick is recommended by Dorma
*	standard sizes are 720/ 820/ 870/ 920 x 2040 – all other sizes are specials (ref. Titan (Geoff Stoddart) – 12.12.08)
*	min. secondary leaf to accommodate closer = 450w
*	38d pressed steel frame
*	Generally considered that 1200w x 2400h leaves (at 38 thick) will be covered against bowing, dimensional stability etc. However wider leaves can be made but no warrantee re dimensional stability. Background: Karen Smith (Australasian Fire Doors ph: 9971 2600) 
*	Consider min.45 thick leaves for leaves over 1100w

## 2-hour Fire rated doors

Assume

*	48 thick (= Pyropanel; E-core = 47mm) NB. 38 thick FD typically used for retrofits (ref. Titan (Geoff Stoddart) – 12.12.08)

## WC Pivot sets (LWD pivot)

Assume

*	5mm trailing edge gap, 3mm leading edge gap and 60 from trailing edge of leaf to centreline pivot (suits WC pivot)
*	40 thick leaf
*	(NB Cemac requires 48d head for top pivot at frame check stage where leaf is aligned on room side due to clash of return on frame vs. pivot pt)              

## Transom closer pivot sets (Dorma RTS 85 transom closer) eg pivot fire doors

Assume

*	5mm trailing edge gap, 3mm leading edge gap and 65 from trailing edge of leaf to centreline pivot 
*	48 thick leaf for FR (used in table below) / 45 for NFR leaf
*	40d pressed steel frame – suits transom closer at head (and assumed to apply to jambs) – (NB Cemac requires 48d head for transom closers at frame check stage)

NB this configuration determines the worst case doorset size ie due to wider frame and greater trailing edge gap.

## Heights

BCA: Min. 1980 clear ht (clear of all hardware eg EMLs and closer arm when door is open, not just frame)

HFG: Clear ht to be clear of all hardware eg electromag locks (EMLs), closers. Recommends 2030 clear ht as adequate, though 2330h to suit bariatric and special equipment (See AHFG Part C cl. 710.25.00)

If 2040h leaf / 2100h nom. Set/ 2025 nom. clear ht to u/s FR frame (NB. 10.5 blockwork courses)

*	set ht = 0mm flooring + 10max. gap for FR door + 2040h leaf + 3 gap + 38 h frame = 2091mm 
*	clear ht for 15h door stop on NFR frame = 2091 - 38 - 15 - 0 =  2038
*	clear ht for 25h doorstop on FR frame = 2091 – 38 - 25 – 0 = 2028
*	RNSH used typically 2040h leaf and with EMLs on push side (EMLX) or with auto operators on push side (AP), only just achieved 1980h clear of hardware.

Alternatives

*	2140h leaf / nom 2200h set/ 2125 nom. clear ht to u/s FR frame (suits block wall only - 11 courses) – adopted as MCR std door leaf ht uno; should provide 2080 clear of all hardware (EMLX, AP) .
*	2240h leaf / nom 2300h set/ 2225 nom. clear ht to u/s FR frame (dry wall only)
*	2340h leaf / nom. 2400h set/ 2325 nom. clear ht to u/s FR frame (suits block wall only - 12 courses) Used on RNSH as typical EDB door ht  but may have been overkill in hindsight
*	2540h leaf / nom. 2600h set/ 2525 nom. clear ht to u/s FR frame (suits block wall only - 13 courses)

NB: RNSH typically had 2040h leaves (2100h set) but this only ensures 1980 clear ht (clear of hardware). BVN would have preferred min. 100 higher ie 2200h set to comply with PPP Spec.


## Clearances for Concrete Openings

Clearances for reinforced conc fire stair shafts: allow 25mm to either side and over doorset (BVN suggested 25mm but on Campbelltown, Abigroup wanted 30mm). However, Abigroup ended up with larger leaves which threw out the hardware schedule as some leaves became wider than 1000 and would then need 4 hinges.

Beware

*	Mental health doors with concealed closers – may require 50 thick doors depending on leaf width (over 100 leaf) and wider secondary leaf (540 tbc?)
*	NBH had 50 thick leaves on MH bed room and MH Ensuite doors; other MH doors were min 45 thick. Considerations of MH DGIV obs panel installations and Hipac hinges.
*	Door seals reducing clearances – would not impact on clear opening and WL of double doors. Could impact on clear opening and WL to single leaf doors if mounted on pressed steel stops.
*	Requirement for 400d smoke reservoirs for fire/ smoke doors if required under BCA. BCA Spec C2.5 cl.4) with respect to doorset hts, u/s ceilings and bulkheads.

Criteria

*	Compliance essential for BCA 2013 and AS 1428.1- 2009
*	For clinical areas, general compliance to AHFGs 

## Revit Door Leaf Type Family Conventions and Coding

First off, RVT door families from NBH are not to be measured and taken as exactly accurate. 
They are based on pressed steel door frames, so will be indicative only if it is decided later than they are to be otherwise eg special joinery doors, al framed suites etc.
They are deliberately diagrammatic to allow the doorset (overall frame width) to remain constant and allow a degree of tolerance without impacting on the setout within the room/ space. Tolerances will be required to permit refinement during projects eg for fire ratings, pivot v. hinged configurations for egress. It is impractical and inefficient to model exact door families. As such, do not measure off RVT to determine clear opening widths and the like.

Main Revit family coding indicates door size eg D150 indicates single leaf door with 990w leaf. D230 indicates 2-leaf door with 990 + 520w leaves. For NBH door families, leaf hts are typically 2140h providing nom 2200h doorset.

Door leaf types are indicated by letter suffixes eg a = solid leaf (no glazing); b = small obs panel (SOBS), c = fire rated obs panel (FOBS), p = peephole eg D150a, D150b, D150c, D150p

If “_p” is also added, the door is pivot action eg D150a_p is a solid 990w leaf which swings in both directions. Please keep pivot doors to a minimum to minimise acoustic, visual privacy issues and smoke sealing issues as applicable. Revit families for pivot doors have a solid arc indicating typical swing direction and dotted arc indicating less preferred direction of swing. 

Different door hts are coded with suffixes eg D230a_24 would indicate 2340h leaves/ 2400h set.
